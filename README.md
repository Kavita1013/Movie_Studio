## About :

In this fast-paced life, where cars are about to fly and robots are ready to replace humans, spending time on little things can put you behind in this rat race of life!!. Don't worry, Movie Studio brings you movie suggestions on your tips so that you don’t lag behind in finding the “correct” fit for the mood you crave.
  
  #### a) What this app brings to the table?
  
The app currently is a small prototype built on the crux of the recommendation system. It delivers its users top-rated movies at par with the current trend of the world, along with helping them choose the movie to relish their entertainment buds to the best.
  
  
  #### b) Technologies used

The application is developed in  Android Studio, and coded in Java. Extensive use of The Movie Database API  done to get details of the movie in different parts of the app. The recommendation system is a Content-based filtering engine, that predicts and suggests users based on its users’ history. Techstack for the recommendation system is as below.

a) Python – 3.x <br/>
b) Pandas – 1.2.4 <br/>
c) Scikit-learn – 0.24.1 <br/>

  c) Challenges Faced 
  
As my prowess lies in the domain of Android App development, the major challenge was the making of a recommendation system with the required conditions. A lot of background search and relentless binge-watching of videos helped me build the recommendation system implemented in the app submitted. Deployment of the python script was also a first-hand experience yet rewarding as it helped me understand Azure and its working better. Optimization of android app code is also a hurdle faced during the making of this app.
  
  
  d) Future prospects

As specified earlier, this is a basic prototype, and an upgrade to this is always a possibility. Some of the advancements include:

a) Adding like and dislike count tracking which helps to increase the accuracy of the recommendation system.

b) More modes can be added to suggest movies to suit every individual

c)This app stands as a testament to the community it envisions to build, bringing all movie lovers together and catering to the needs of the general public. Login and community-related features can be added to scale this app even further.

d) As we as a generation are rebasing from TV and theaters to OTT platforms, we can expand this app to cover OTT-based media and its rating system.


## Motivation behind the project:

IMDb, forever that's the go-to spot for all movie fanatics who attend Friday's first show of almost all movies, drawing inspiration from the same, Movie studio is the amalgamation of recommendation system and community forum serving all movie lovers at once. With the motto of “Minding the movie, we consume” this app aims to preserve the golden age of cinema by providing insights and suggesting movies, personally curated just for the user.


## Thought Process and Research Involved:

I tried going through related projects which revolve around the same theme, to research the features each project had to offer and bring a combination of them all. To better learn the tech stack, I tried going through the documentation and watching some tutorials for the same. The design and UI-UX inspiration was drawn from classic design websites like [“Behance”](https://www.behance.net/) and [“Dribble”](https://dribbble.com/). Overall, for this project, a lot of studies related to the functionality of the product and how optimized code can be delivered on the codebase were done.


## How to Install and Run the Project

#### 1. For Android App:

(i)   Clone the project onto your local machine either using Github or Android Studio.
(ii)  Open the project on Android Studio.
(iii) Connect your mobile device to your machine and turn on USB debugging.
(iv)  Click on the run button(or Shift+F10) and install the app on your mobile device.

####  Please Note: APK is also uploaded here.


### 2. Recommendation System:

#### Libraries:
* Python – 3.x
* Pandas – 1.2.4
* Scikit-learn – 0.24.1

To install the above libraries on your machine, use the following command.
*pip install pandas scikit-learn*


#### Project:

1. Unzip the zip file.
2. You will find CSV files put them in the main directory, and delete the rest of the folder.
3. Run the flask app
4. Input can be of the form : "text"="The Avengers"
5. Hit a POST request with the input of your choice.
